# Password Generator

## first steps
I have used some psuedo code from my professor to help get started on creating the Prompt method and confirm methods.  I also have been using w3 schools as reference for how to employ these answers into conditional statements.  I have been sure to log all of these prompts and confirm messages into the console so that I am able to see what data is being held inside of the variables and move on with the function.
## Thinking out Loud
If the user picks all 4 options, then that will be the easiest type of code to start with.  I would create an object in an array and generate random letters, numbers, and symbols based off the length of said array.  In an attempt to play with random strings of the four options (lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numbers) a second javascript file will be created called "random.js"

## additional fancy things for later
-a message that confirms how many numbers they want
-a selector confirm message that allows them to pick yes or no to the options of lowercase, Uppercase, numbers, and symbols
